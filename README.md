# Andrew's Sane Lab Dotfiles
I made this because it seemed like most of the current lab dot files are a mess... Paths
are mix of software from all over the different NIL systems, so it becomes really difficult to
figure out what versions of things folks are sometimes using.

This repo contains a clone of my dotfiles (which imo is neatly organized and includes several
useful shell features). It is meant for use specifically for our lab systems only (so `maeve` and `rocinante` only, `heisenberg` is currently not supported).

## Installation

Simply run the line below:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gitlab.com/DosenbachGreene/dotfiles/-/raw/master/install.sh)"
```

Then follow and answer the dialog questions that appear.
